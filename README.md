# A Virtual Pet Game - Fox Game

We are going to use webpack bundler. It has a rich ecosystem. We will use parcel.

npm i -D parcel-bundler - to install parcel - for developer tool (like i don't want parcel to ship to the web server)

Never edit package-lock.json by hand. It locks all the version of the dependencies so when a someone reinstalls the project they can take all the versions from here.

.cache will save a bunch of stuff so it doesn't have to recompile. It speeds up the build.

dist folder will have all the compiled HTML, CSS and JavaScript from the the src files.
